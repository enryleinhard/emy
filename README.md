# Emy

Introducing Emy a distribution dashboard to optimize routes for reducing carbon emissions and costs. Emy provides an optimized route based on placed orders which can calculate the most minimal emission rate for supply chain distribution. We provide a tracking app for drivers which are automatically sent to companies' Emy dashboards for easier reporting. Emy provides a near approximation of carbon emissions by taking into account the weight of trucks in each stop.
